# Version Managemant and Other Plan

* why do this: for fun.

* Previous Version Name: (`WindTop 3.10`) `Rev.Beta 3`

* Next Plan Version Name:
    + `testing`: simplify it, try to make it more stable than `master` version, easier to install, deploy it on different platform or containers.
    + `current`: test, test, and test new feature, or something significant attempts.

* preparing version name about `testing`:

    + `v0.95`: aka. `REV-BETA4`, for naming style is becoming different.
        - `v0.95.1`: aka. `REV-BETA4.1`, detail fixes based on v0.95
        - `v0.95.2`: aka. `REV-BETA4.2`, detail fixes based on v0.95.1
        - `v0.95.3`: aka. `REV-BETA4.3`, plan to be the final release of `v0.95-testing`.

    + `v0.96`: no `REV-BETA` prefix, just `DreamBBS Version 0.96`
        - features in plan: 
          * sorted common library and refined structure.
          * split out sample file to another repository.
          * other detail changes from Current version.

* preparing version name about `current`:
    + `v1.0-CURRENT`: developing for preparing version 1.0.
    + `vX.0-CURRENT`: developing for preparing version X.0.

* backports:
    + something significant bug fixes or detail changed, port this commits back to `testing` version.
