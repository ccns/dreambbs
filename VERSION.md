# To-Do and Version Plan

## Conventions of Version Number fields
- `M`: Major version
- `N`: Minor version
- `P`: Patch version
- `Q` and so on: Additional fields
- n consecutive lower case letter(s) (`m`, `nn`, ...): A n-digit corresponding field
- `x`: A general 1-digit field

## Legacy Versioning Scheme - `MD.N.P.Q` or simply `M.N.P.Q`
The versioning scheme originated from MapleBBS.

To referring DreamBBS-specific versions, the letter `D` can be appended to the `M` part. In addition, DreamBBS versions before v4.0.0 can be collectively called `MapleBBS 3D`.

For MapleBBS 3, the form `3.nn.P.Q` is used, e.g., `3.00` (not `3.0`) and `3.02` (not `3.2`).
- It is acceptable to view these two digits as `np`: `N` is `0` and `P` is `2`, and thus the legacy versioning scheme for MapleBBS 3 is instead `3.np.Q.R`.
    However, this view is not adopted in this article.

Before the introduction of the 2018 versioning scheme, the latest version name was `3.10 Rev.Beta 3` (inherited from WindTopBBS), and the `.P` part was not actually used.
- However, it is acceptable to view `Rev.Beta 3` as the `.P` part (`3`).

The `.Q` part is reserved for mapping version names in the current versioning scheme before `4D.0.0`/`v4.0.0`.

## The 2018 Versioning Scheme - `vM.N.P` 
Note the presence of `v`.

The versioning scheme introduced in 2018, now deprecated.

Each release using the 2018 versioning scheme has a corresponding legacy version number as well:
- For `M` â‰¤ `3`, `vM.N.P` corresponding to `3D.X.N.P`, where each possible `M` maps to a unique `X`.

For DreamBBS v3, the form `vM.n.P` is used, e.g., `v3.0` (not `v3.00`) and `v3.2` (not `v3.02`). The next major release after DreamBBS v3.3 will be DreamBBS v4.0, so that `N` will not be larger than `9`.

It is acceptable to omit the `v` prefix for DreamBBS because using `M.N.P` along actually does not cause ambiguities:
- DreamBBS derived from MapleBBS not before MapleBBS 2.36, so before DreamBBS v3 (i.e., `M` < `3`), `DreamBBS M.N` refers to `vM.N` but not `MD.N`
- DreamBBS v3 and MapleBBS 3 use different numbers of digits for `N`, so `DreamBBS 3.nn` refers to `3D.nn` but not `v3.nn`, while `DreamBBS 3.n` refers to `v3.n` but not `3D.n`.

However, to avoid confusions, these 2 schemes can be explicitly differentiated by using `MD.N.P` vs. `vM.N.P`.

The version number `M.N.P` will be consistent with the legacy versioning scheme for `4D.0.0`/`v4.0.0` and on.

## Branches of Development
The new development workflow has led to the two main branches seen today: Release and `current`, which are explained in the following paragraphs.

From v3.0 and on, no dedicated git branches for releases will be created. Instead, new releases on the release development branch are published based on git tags from the `master` branch.

After v3.0, there are unstable branches for the convenience of testing as well: `develop` and `<user>/develop`.

The stages of the overall development workflow after v3.0, from the most unstable to the most stable:
- `<user>/develop`
    - The developer's develop branch for self-review
    - Other names can be used in place of the `develop` at the developer's intention
    - Force-updates can be performed at any time at the developer's intention
    - As soon as the commits themselves are checked to not have problems, these commits should be merged onto `develop` (fast-forwarding is preferred)
- `develop`
    - The branch for commits which need review from the maintainers
    - Force-updates require acknowledge and agreement from all maintainers in advance
    - As soon as the review are done, the commits should be merged onto `master` (fast-forwarding is preferred)
    - Pull requests should target this branch
- `master`
    - The stable branch where the functionality are reviewed by the maintainers
    - Force-updates should not be performed on this branch
- Releases
    - The git tags added on `master` at times
    - The referenced commit should not be changed after the changelog is published

## Release Branch (formerly `testing`)
This branch emphasize more on the stability, the easiness to install, and the ability to deploy on different platform and containers, than the `current` branch.

Versioning Scheme: `vM.N.P`, or just `M.N.P` after `4.0.0`
  - `M`: Major version; indicates significant changes
  - `N`: Minor version; indicates introduction of new features
  - `P`: Patch version; indicates bug fixes or security improvement; based on the previous version
  - `v0.N` refers to the branch for `v0.N.P` versions
  - For `M` > 0, `vM.0` refers to the branch for `vM.N.P` versions

## `master` Branch (Current Branch)
This branch has new features or significant changes which are being tested.

Former versioning scheme: `vM.0-CURRENT`
  - The corresponding development branch for version `vM.N`

Version scheme after `v3.0`:
  1. The name of the latest release version for its development branch
  2. Or `M.N-CURRENT` for the development branch of upcoming release versions
    - Will be renamed into the real version name upon the official release

Whenever a significant bug fix or change is made in `current`, the related commits will be merged into `testing` branch for the latest release version soon.

However, from v3.0 and on, instead of merge the commits into the dedicated branch, a new release will be published soon.

- [x] `v1.0-CURRENT`
- [x] `v2.0-CURRENT`
- [x] `v3.0-CURRENT` ( **We are HERE** )
