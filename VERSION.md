# To-Do and Version Plan

## Conventions of Version Number fields
- `M`: Major version
- `N`: Minor version
- `P`: Patch version
- `Q` and so on: Additional fields
- n consecutive lower-case letter(s) (`m`, `nn`, ...): A n-digit corresponding field
- `x`: A general 1-digit field
- `CODENAME`: A codename field
- `PRERELEASE`: A pre-release field (starts with `alpha`/`beta`/`rc`)

## Legacy Versioning Scheme - `MD.N.P.Q.R` or simply `M.N.P.Q.R`
The versioning scheme originated from MapleBBS.

To referring DreamBBS-specific versions, the letter `D` can be appended to the `M` part. In addition, DreamBBS versions before v4.0.0 can be collectively called `MapleBBS 3D`.

For `M` = `3` and certain cases of `M` = `2`, the abbreviated form `M.np.Q.R` is used, e.g., `3.00` (not `3.0.0`) and `3.02` (not `3.0.2`).

Before the introduction of the 2018 versioning scheme, the latest version name was `3.10 Rev.Beta 3` (inherited from WindTopBBS), *i.e.*:
- `M` = `3`, `N` = `1`, & `P` = `0`.
- `Q` was not actually used but can be viewed as `3`.

Otherwise, `Q` & `R` are reserved for mapping version names in the 2018 versioning scheme before `4D.0.0`/`v4.0.0`.

## The 2018 Versioning Scheme - `vM.N.P` 
Note the presence of `v`.

The versioning scheme introduced in 2018, now deprecated.

Each release using the 2018 versioning scheme has a corresponding legacy version number as well:
- For `M` â‰¤ `3`, `vM.N.P` corresponding to `3D.xy.N.P`, where each possible `M` maps to a unique `xy`.

For DreamBBS v3, the form `vM.n.P` is used, e.g., `v3.0` (not `v3.00`) and `v3.2` (not `v3.02`). The next major release after DreamBBS v3.3 will be DreamBBS v4.0, so that `N` will not be larger than `9`.

It is acceptable to omit the `v` prefix for DreamBBS because using `M.N.P` along actually does not cause ambiguities:
- DreamBBS derived from MapleBBS not before MapleBBS 2.36, so before DreamBBS v3 (i.e., `M` < `3`), `DreamBBS M.N` refers to `vM.N` but not `MD.N`
- For the 2nd field, DreamBBS v3 allows only 1 digit while MapleBBS 3 allows only 2 digits, so `DreamBBS 3.nn` refers to `3D.nn` but not `v3.nn`, while `DreamBBS 3.n` refers to `v3.n` but not `3D.n`.

However, to avoid confusions, these 2 schemes can be explicitly differentiated by using `MD.N.P` vs. `vM.N.P`.

The version number `M.N.P` will be consistent with the legacy versioning scheme for `4D.0.0`/`v4.0.0` and on.

## Branch/Tag Series
The development workflow introduced in 2018 had led to the two-branch series: RELEASE (formerly TESTING) and CURRENT, which are explained in the following paragraphs.

From v3.0 and on, no dedicated git branches for RELEASE will be created. Instead, new releases on RELEASE are published based on git tags from the `master` branch.

The stages of the overall development workflow after v3.0, from the most unstable to the most stable:
- `<user-or-team>/develop` and PR branches
    - The developer(s)'s develop branch for self-review and peer-review
        - For PR branches, draft PRs are in the self-review stage, while normal PRs are in the peer-review stage.
    - Other names can be used in place of the `develop` at the developer(s)'s intention
    - At the self-review stage, force-updates can be performed at any time at the developer's intention
    - If the commits themselves are checked to not have problems, the peer-review stage should start
    - As soon as the peer-review passes, these commits should be merged onto `master` (fast-forwarding is preferred)
- `master`
    - The branch for commits which passed peer-review
    - Force-updates require acknowledge and agreement from all maintainers in advance
    - Pull requests should target this branch
- `stable`
    - The git tag on `master`, updated when the functionality of `master` is reviewed by the maintainers
- Releases
    - The git tags added on `master` at times
    - The referenced commit should not be changed after the changelog is published

## RELEASE
Before v3.0, RELEASE branches had emphasized more on the stability, the easiness to install, and the ability to deploy on different platform and containers than CURRENT.

These goals have now been transferred to the CURRENT tag `stable`, which is the recommended version for other BBS sites to use.

Versioning Scheme: `vM.N.P`, or just `M.N.P` after `4.0.0`
  - `M`: Major version; indicates significant changes
  - `N`: Minor version; indicates introduction of new features
  - `P`: Patch version; indicates bug fixes or security improvement; based on the previous version
  - `CODENAME` can be omitted for simplicity
    - If `CODENAME` is assigned to a minor version, one of `N` and `CODENAME` can be omitted
  - The present of `PRERELEASE` may indicate potential instability
  - `v0.N` refers to the series of `v0.N.P` versions
  - For `M` > 0, `vM.0` refers to the series of `vM.N.P` versions

This major version is also named `DreamBBS-202X vN`. `202X` refers to the 2020s decade.

This will be the last major version whose version number is different from the legacy version number.

All the previous branches have become end-of-life when `v3.0` was released.

## CURRENT
Before v3.0, CURRENT had had new features or significant changes which were being tested.

CURRENT now consists of the `master` branch and the tag `stable`. The above goals have now been transferred to the branch `master`.

Former versioning scheme: `vM.0-CURRENT`
  - The corresponding CURRENT version for `vM.N`

Version scheme after `v3.0`:
  1. The name of the latest release version of its release series
  2. Or `M.N-CURRENT` for the CURRENT version of the upcoming release series
    - Will be renamed into the real version name upon the official release

Before v3.0, whenever a significant bug fix or change was made in CURRENT, the related commits would have been soon merged into the dedicated RELEASE branch for the latest release version.

From v3.0 and on, a new release will be published soon instead. For less significant fixes or changes, the tag `stable` will be updated soon instead.

## Special Editions

Sometimes, special editions are released on special events.
