# Version Managemant and Other Plan

* why do this: for fun.

* Previous Version Name: `Rev.Beta 3`

* Next Plan Version Name:
    + `testing`: simplify it, try to make it more stable than `master` version, easier to install, deploy it on different platform or containers.
    + `current`: test, test, and test new feature, or something significant attempts.

* preparing version name about `testing`:
    + `v0.95`: aka. `REV-BETA4`, for naming style is becoming different.
    + `v0.95.1`: aka. `REV-BETA4.1`, detail fixes based on v0.95'

* preparing version name about `current`:
    + `v1.0-CURRENT`: developing for preparing version 1.0.
    + `vX.0-CURRENT`: developing for preparing version X.0.

* backports:
    + something significant bug fixes or detail changed, port this commits back to `testing` version.
